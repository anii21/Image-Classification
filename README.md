# Image-Classification
●	This contains a CNN model for image classification, to achieve high accuracy on Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle.

●	Implemented optimized model with convolutional layers, pooling, and batch normalization.

●	Trained the model using TensorFlow and Keras, optimized model parameters and evaluated its performance.

●	Employed dropout regularization, batch normalization, and complexity optimization to reduce overfitting.
